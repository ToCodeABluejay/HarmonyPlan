# 5yearplan
Java socialist planning software based upon Paul Cockshott's original software.

This software serves pretty much the same exact functionality, however a lot of excess files from the project and redundant code have been purged, making it easier to navigate and read. A good next step would be to go through and improve overall documentation to the greatest extent possible. In addition, the ability to use commonly used database alternative to plain CSV files would likely prove incredibly useful, whether JSON or a RDBMS.

Note: this software can be used to quickly and efficiently calculate a multi-year economic plan for an industrial economy. This software can only be used to do the plain material and labor calculations. This is be itself insufficient to create a full collectively own, democratically run, socialist planned economy. 

Other things which are not currently taken into consideration:

	* Renumeration (how to determine how people get paid)
	* Distribution (similar to renumeration but in some ways distinct)
	* Foreign trade (while targets for a product or an industry can be estimated, it does not include how those numbers are created and the various different other facets which may affect things concerning international trade)
	* Democratic decision making and economic feedback (one could imagine, when aiming to construct a socialist economy it is necessary to establish such on a democratic basis and foundation. This application provides no means by itself for democratic decision making for constructive feedback)
	* Enterprise management (this issue ties into the previous. Methods should be established for feedback from consumers to producers as well as communication between producers. Enterprises should strive to make improvements and share revelations and procedural improvements and breakthroughs cooperatively and freely to other places of production. A common interface which can serve to facilitate this process and streamline it to improve socialist managerial practices is of quite practical importance.)
